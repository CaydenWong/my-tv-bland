    "summary": "<p>Kate Humble and Ben Fogle return to Longleat Safari Park for another spectacular summer series following the fascinating stories of the exotic animals and the keepers who look after them.</p><p>Earlier in the series, the wolf pack was rocked by the death of pregnant mother Aliska. She died whilst she was in labour along with her pups. Now, another problem is looming, and this time the focus is on her partner, Jango. He has been showing signs of a urinary infection, so the keepers have brought him into the wolf house. It's soon obvious that the problem is bladder stones, but if the vets cannot flush them through, Jango's only other option is a risky operation. The keepers are nervous because this was exactly the condition that caused the death of much-loved timber wolf Dave.</p><p>At the park, keepers often need to come to the aid of an animal in need, so sometimes it's nice to stop and admire the beauty and majesty of the creatures, which is exactly what wildlife cameraman Hamza Yassin has an opportunity to do today with the cheetahs. With his zoom lens, Hamza is able to get close enough to see their incredible claws, which unlike most cats' cannot retract, and investigate their incredible markings, which are not just on their fur but in fact go right through to their skin.</p><p>Also today, Thorn the giraffe is being trained so that he can receive a giant pedicure, zoologist Megan McCubbin serves up some ice lollies to the donkeys to try to keep them cool, and Ben creates a scent trail for one of his favourite animals, the tapir.</p>",

The large raised planter right outside the back doors - nicknamed the sarcophagus - is outdated and dominates the garden, and John and Vanessa are desperate for it to go, but they are keen for the materials to be reused to make the most of their £4,000 budget. John loves a fire, and the couple love to entertain, so they need space for an area in which to socialise. The gloomy garage with north-facing wall needs brightening up, and shade-tolerant planting will do the job. Will Chris's wadi-inspired desert garden complete with oasis pond win the day, or will Charlie's more gentle blend of cottage and courtyard persuade the couple to choose her design?</p>",

Lorraine is a medical secretary and Shelley is a full-time parent. Most of Lorraine's items are heirlooms from her father, uncle and grandmother, with some pieces dating back to the early part of the 19th century. There are all sorts to explore, from vintage instruments to tea sets and family portraits. Much of Lorraine's stuff holds considerable sentimental value for Lorraine. But Shelley is very keen for her mum to have a good clearout and let go of some of it. There's plenty for Kammy and appraiser Kayleigh to go through, but is there anything of valuable to be found? This family have had a tough couple of years and they'd like to raise the money for all three generations to go away together on holiday. But will the sales at auction be enough to help them realise their dream?</p>",

    "summary": "<p>When Ian and Julie moved into their Surrey cottage nearly 20 years ago, they discovered a curious wall painting in one of the bedrooms. They had no idea who put it there. Julie wanted to get rid of it as it didn't match her decor plans, while their four-year-old wanted to colour it in with her crayons.</p><p>Ian was about to paint over it when an elderly neighbour popped round and introduced himself. He'd heard from one of the previous owners of the cottage that the work was by famous abstract artist Ben Nicholson.</p><p>Ben Nicholson was one of the greatest British artists of the 20th century. Born in 1894, he became a key figure in the European avant-garde. He was a pioneer of modernism who rejected conventional ways of painting and experimented with bold new means of expression. In a career spanning more than six decades, his abstract works were among the most influential in British art.</p><p>Over the years, Ian and Julie have shown the work to experts from the art world, but they have doubts. Is this work by the master of British modernism, or is it an artful copy by a follower?</p><p>Getting to the bottom of the mystery has recently become a matter of urgency. Ian is a builder, and he's midway through constructing an extension to the cottage. He's concerned the building work might put this potential masterpiece at risk of damage and destruction. If the team can prove the painting is genuine, it could be worth £200,000. But this poses a dilemma for the owners - if it is by Ben Nicholson, then a sizable chunk of their bedroom wall might have to be removed in order to preserve the painting.</p><p>How could a work by Ben Nicholson have ended up on Ian and Julie's bedroom wall? To find out, Fiona and Philip need to look into the previous owners of the cottage. Did they have any connections to Nicholson, and if so, can it be proved that Nicholson visited the cottage? Fiona heads to the Tate to delve into a vast collection of Ben Nicholson's letters. Meanwhile, Philip enlists the help of the Courtauld Institute to try to find out how the wall painting was constructed and what it's made of.</p><p>This thrilling investigation takes us to across the country on the trail of a master of British modernism. Is the wall painting in Ian and Julie's house a genuine work by Ben Nicholson, and if so, can it be safely removed from the cottage?</p>",

In front of each celebrity is a cloche, underneath which is an ingredient. Each celebrity has a different ingredient and must create one dish showcasing that ingredient to demonstrate to the judges they have potential.</p><p>Next, it's the Street Food Challenge. The celebrities are presented with a street food dish that is popular throughout Japan. They must taste it and try to identify its ingredients. Then, following not a recipe but their instincts, they must cook this classic national dish for themselves. Will their attempts impress, or will they fall short of the mark?</p><p>Then, in the final test of culinary creativity, the contestants are asked to prepare their Dinner Party Dish - something they would cook to impress if someone was coming round to eat. At the end of this test, one of them will be going home.</p>",
